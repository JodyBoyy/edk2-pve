Description: edk2 based legacy 2MB UEFI firmware modules for virtual machines
 Open Virtual Machine Firmware is a build of EDK II for 64-bit, 32-bit x86
 virtual machines. It includes full support for UEFI, including Secure Boot,
 allowing use of UEFI in place of a traditional BIOS in your VM.
 This packages includes a static build of legacy images that got dropped from
 upstream because the small size results in to many limitations, but Proxmox VE
 still needs to provide backward compat for older VMs.
